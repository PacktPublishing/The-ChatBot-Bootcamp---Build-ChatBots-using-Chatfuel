A Chatbot is an autonomous tool that can interact with users using conversational messaging. Conversational messaging is the absolute best way to interact with your audience. A chatbot opens up millions of avenues & opportunities for your business. For instance, a customer service chatbot can interact with your customers on Facebook to provide them support and answers to most common problems. A marketing chatbot can promote and even sell products, all from the comforts of Facebook Messenger. On the other hand, you can build a smart service that pulls information from various sources and presents it to the user as a chat message! The possibilities are endless. Today, users spend more time in messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger, than on websites and other social media platforms. A chatbot allows your business to be where your customers are at.
