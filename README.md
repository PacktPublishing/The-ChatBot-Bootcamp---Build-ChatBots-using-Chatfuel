## About the Video Course
Build professional grade Chatbots for Facebook Messenger with this course. Chatfuel is the platform of choice for such brands as Netflix, Adidas, HTC, TechCrunch, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, MTV, Reebok and thousands more. If your business doesn’t have a chatbot on Facebook Messenger, then you’re missing out on a huge opportunity to turbo charge your marketing and keep your customers and clients engaged with your brand. A Chatbot is an autonomous tool that can interact with users using conversational messaging. Conversational messaging is the absolute best way to interact with your audience. A chatbot opens up millions of avenues & opportunities for your business. For instance, a customer service chatbot can interact with your customers on Facebook to provide them support and answers to most common problems. A marketing chatbot can promote and even sell products, all from the comforts of Facebook Messenger. On the other hand, you can build a smart service that pulls information from various sources and presents it to the user as a chat message! The possibilities are endless. Today, users spend more time in messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger, than on websites and other social media platforms. A chatbot allows your business to be where your customers are at.
